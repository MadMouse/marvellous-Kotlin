This Demo is written purley in Kotlin and testing done using Spek. 
     
     
     
## What weâ€™re looking for:

Proof of Java or Kotlin knowledge.

How you load and display data from external sources.

Clean, testable code and application of S.O.L.I.D principles.

Use of an architectural pattern such as MVP, MVVM or other.

    MVP model used.
    
How you unit test your code.

    Used Spek for Testing. Implemented rudementry testing.
    
Use of industry standard libraries such as Dagger, RxJava and Retrofit to name a few.

    # Libraries:
         1.) Picasso,
         2.) Retrofit.

## Nice to have:

100% Kotlin codebase.

    Built the App from the ground up using Kotlin and used Spek for Testing.

Slick user interface.
  

Use of Architecture Components.


UI tests using Espresso.

    

Use of persistence frameworks for offline storage.

    TODO Architecture can be extended to handle local storage using Realm / SQL list using a Respositry model.
    
    
    
## Todo - Improvements:

    1.) Screen Rotation needs to be optermized.
    2.) Tests to be completed.
    3.) Detail Activity to be added.
    4.) Local persistance and caching - add favourite handling.
    5.) Dagger implementation - started implmentation in DI folder but project does not justify implenetation.
    6.) Testing using Expresso when more user interactions are implemented
